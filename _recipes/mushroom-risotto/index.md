  Original recipe by [Jamie Oliver](https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/rice-recipes/grilled-mushroom-risotto/).

  - 150g of different mushrooms (or ~20g dried), sliced
  - 1 small onion, chopped
  - 200g arborio rice
  - 1 bottle of white wine (100ml for the recipe, rest for drinking)
  - 250ml of chicken stock (or use the water from rehydrating the mushrooms)
  - 50g parmesan cheese
  - 1 tablespoon butter
  - salt and pepper for seasoning
  - olive oil
  - dill for garnish

directions: |
  If you’re using dry mushrooms, the day before put them into cold water and keep them in the fridge for 24 hours. Dry the mushrooms with a paper towel - but don’t throw away the water, it will come in handy later! 

  Fry the onion for 5 minutes on a low heat in a bit of olive oil, and then add the mushrooms and rice. After the rice will be coated in oil, deglaze the pan with a splash of wine. Now every 5 minutes you need to add the liquid of choosing (stock or water from mushrooms) in small batches, mix well, and let the rice absorb it. Try to do it in 6 batches, for 30 minutes - if you run out of the liquid, just use the rest of the wine.

  After this, turn the heat off, throw in a tablespoon of butter, your grated cheese, salt and pepper, and mix well. Let it sit (perfectly under a cover, so it won’t dry) for 5 minutes, and you’re done!

The shop next to me sells a set of dried mushrooms - completely random mix, some chanterelles, porcinis, and of course, champignons. I decided to take it back home and make the most boring dish ever - risotto.
