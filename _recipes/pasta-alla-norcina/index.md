  Original recipe by [Not Another Cooking Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9anYheWVlA).

  For 1-2 portions:
  - 150g of Rigatoni or Penne pasta
  - 80g of Salsiccia (one small sausage)
  - 1-2 cloves of garlic
  - 100ml of semi-dry white wine
  - 100ml of heavy cream
  - 75g of Pecorino Romano, grated
  - Olive oil
  - Salt and pepper to taste

directions: |
  Prepare the pasta according to packaging instructions until al dente. You can do that at the same time as the sauce, so both will finish at the same time.

  Cut open the sausage and shred with hands into small bite sized pieces. Season with a bit of salt and throw in on hot oil together with two cloves of smashed garlic on the pan and let the meat brown on all sides (preferably don’t touch it initially for 3 minutes). Remove the garlic, lower the heat and deglaze the pan with wine. Raise the heat again and once the wine evaporates, lower the heat again and add cream. Once the cream will thicken into brownish sauce, add in the pasta together with a bit of pasta water. Mix all well together for a minute and turn the heat off. Add most of the cheese into the pan and mix vigorously until you’ll get a good consistency.

  Serve sprinkled with more Pecorino Romano and freshly ground pepper.

Beautiful, yet such a simple dish. Pasta made with Italian sausage, heavy cream and wine. All the flavors come together and can still be distinguished well in the final dish. Originally created in Norcia, in the Umbria region in Italy.
