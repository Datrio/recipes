title: Camembert and Chicken Salad
date: 2020-05-10
tags: salad, chicken, cheese

ingredients: |
  - Two/three iceberg lettuce leaves cut in smaller pieces
  - Camembert cut into slices (or Brie)
  - Fried chicken breast seasoned with salt and pepper
  - Pumpkin seeds
  - Cranberry jam

directions: |
  Fry the chicken breast in a bit of oil on low heat, or prepare in any other way you want (you can boil it if you don’t want to fry it). Either assemble everything in layers like on the photo, or just mix all together and drizzle with cranberry jam.

  Ideas on how to modify the salad:
  - Add some julienned carrots or cherry tomatoes cut in quarters if you want more veggies
  - The original recipe had dried cranberries, but that made the salad a bit too dry - adding some salad dressing (like a vinaigrette) would counter that
  - The original also had sunflower seeds, but I had pumpkin seeds on hand - but that shows that any will work!
  - If you want to keep it vegetarian, you can replace the chicken with some fried tofu
  - Feeling extremely lazy? Just go to a shop, buy a salad base, some precooked chicken breast and all the other ingredients

For years I was taking the Berlin-Warsaw Express train every two, three weeks. And whenever I was there, I loved going to the dining car and ordering this salad. I modified it a lot since then, but that’s the beauty of salads - you can modify whatever you want in them and they’ll still be amazing.
