title: Bulgogi Beef
date: 2020-05-29
tags: korean, meat, beef, grill

ingredients: |
  For the marinade:

  - Half an onion
  - 3 cloves of garlic
  - 1 kiwi
  - 50g of brown sugar
  - 1 tablespoon of paprika
  - 100ml of soy sauce
  - 25ml of sesame oil
  - 3 spring onions
  
  For marination:
  - 200g of rib eye steak, cut into thin slices
  - Half an onion, sliced
  - 2 spring onions, cut into 4cm pieces

directions: |
  Put all the marinade ingredients into a blender and blend together until creamy. Into a container, put the thinly sliced pieces of beef, onion and spring onions, and cover with the marinade. Leave in the fridge for ~10 hours (2 hours should be enough, but the longer, the better).

  Now you have multiple options of grilling - you can do it on a normal grill, a contact grill (what I used) or in a cast iron skillet. Whatever you choose, just fry the meat and onions with a bit of sesame oil for 2-3 minutes.

  Serve with rice, or as I did, with some cauliflower rice. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.

As much as I understood, the traditional bulgogi beef should be marinated with Asian pear pur√©e, but due to lack of them in Berlin, I had to resort to using a kiwi to tenderise the meat. The real one probably tastes different, but this was great in any case.
