title: Beef Tartare
date: 2021-08-12
tags: french, meat

ingredients: |
  - 150g beef tenderloin, chopped
  - 4 small pickled gherkins, chopped
  - 2 tablespoons capers, chopped
  - 1 shallot, chopped
  - 2 tablespoons parsley, chopped
  - 2 tablespoons chives, chopped
  - 2 anchovies, chopped
  - 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
  - 2 tablespoons of ketchup
  - Salt and pepper to taste
  - Olive oil
  - Rocket leaves for garnish
  - Egg yolk

directions: |
  Chop the beef into really small cubes (freeze the beef beforehand for 30 minutes to make it easier). In a bowl mix with the olive oil, so the meat won’t get too mushy when combined. Chop the other ingredients, throw into the same bowl and mix together with a fork. Add the sauce, ketchup, salt and pepper, and mix together.

  Put in a ring mold and flatten with a spoon or fork. Remove the mold, gently put rocket leaves on top and finish by putting an egg yolk in the centre.

I was always afraid of eating beef tartare. I mean, raw meat? Raw egg yolk? What is this madness? But when I tried it, all the fresh ingredients came together, I could still distinguish between each element and I loved the combination. As long as you buy good quality meat and eggs, don’t be worried and try it out!
