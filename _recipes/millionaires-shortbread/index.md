title: Millionaire’s Shortbread
date: 2021-08-09
tags: sweets, cookies

ingredients: |
  For the shortbread layer:
  - 60g of brown sugar
  - 125g of melted unsalted butter
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  - 1 teaspoon kosher salt
  - 200g of flour
  - Powdered sugar for sprinkling
  
  For the caramel layer:
  - 30g of melted unsalted butter
  - 200ml sweetened condensed milk
  - 125g brown sugar
  - 25g of honey
  - 50ml of heavy cream
  - A bit of kosher salt
  
  For the chocolate layer:
  - 200g of dark chocolate
  - Flake salt for sprinkling

directions: |
  Melt the butter, add it to the sugar, vanilla extract and salt. When combined into a smooth paste, mix together with flour. Spread at the bottom of a baking dish, press with your hands into a flat surface and pierce with a fork everywhere. Sprinkle the powdered sugar on top and put into the oven for 180°C for 20 minutes. After cooking, let cool down an hour.

  In a pot combine all the caramel ingredients. Stir to combine. Once it starts bubbling, don’t stop stirring. Cook until it’ll achieve 115°C. Remove from heat immediately while still stirring, and spread on top of the shortbread layer in the baking dish. Let it cool until thick, around 30 minutes.

  Cut the chocolate into small chunks with a knife. Leave 40-50 grams for tempering, melt the rest in a double boiler while whisking. Once it’ll pass 50°C, remove from the heat, put in the rest of the chocolate chunks, melt well to combine and spread on top of the caramel. Sprinkle with flake salt.

  Let cool in fridge completely, cut into small bars of your liking with a hot knife and serve.

I like to call these “Gourmet Twix Bars”, since they consist of the same thing - a shortbread layer, gooey caramel layer, and a hard chocolate on top. A sprinkle of salt on top elevates this even more. And it’s not that hard to make!
