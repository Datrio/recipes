  Original recipe by [Marcella Hazan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcella_Hazan), presented by [Ethan Chlebowski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21zsjzFKOrI).

  - 2 garlic cloves
  - 20g of pine nuts
  - 45g of basil leaves
  - 30g of Parmesan
  - 10g of Pecorino Romano
  - 60ml of olive oil
  - 20g of butter
  - Salt for taste

directions: |
  If using a blender, just throw everything (without the fats) together with a big pinch of salt, and blend. Afterwards add the olive oil, mix, add butter, mix, and youâ€™re done.

  If using a mortar and pestle, first smash the garlic with salt, then one by one, mix in until incorporated, while adding a small pinch of salt each time - the pine nuts, basil leaves and finally both cheeses. When you have a paste, mix in the oil in 3-4 batches. Lastly, add the butter and add salt for taste.

  Should be enough for 300g of pasta. Remember to mix it in with the pasta water before mixing it with the pasta.

Sure, you can just buy a jar from the store, but the homemade one is so, so, SO much more rich. The combination of fresh basil and fresh garlic give this so much flavour. I did in a mortar and pestle, but I can assume it would be way faster to make in a blender.
