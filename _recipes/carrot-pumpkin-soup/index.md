title: Carrot Pumpkin Soup
date: 2020-05-25
tags: vegan, vegetarian, soup, vegetables, pumpkin

ingredients: |
  - 250g of pumpkin in any form (I got a pumpkin puree, since it’s out of season)
  - 1 bell pepper, chopped
  - 250g of carrots, chopped
  - 1-2 small red onions, chopped
  - 2 cloves of garlic, chopped
  - 500ml of vegetable stock
  - Olive oil
  - Salt and pepper to taste

directions: |
  Mix all the chopped vegetables together and put them on medium heat in a bit of olive oil so they’ll soften. If using a normal pumpkin, add it along with the other vegetables and mix every few minutes. If you’re using pumpkin puree, add it after the vegetables will be ready.

  Add the vegetable stock and cook all together for 15 minutes, mixing every few minutes.

  Put into a blender and mix everything to the desired consistency. Season to taste. Top up with roasted pumpkin seeds.

Lately I’ve complaining I’m not eating enough veggies, so I decided to make a hearty soup. And it’s vegan as well, which makes so much better. Since I like some crunch in my food, I’ve added more pumpkin seeds to give some extra bite.
