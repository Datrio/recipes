ingredients: |
  Original recipe by [The Pioneer Woman](https://thepioneerwoman.com/food-and-friends/5-epic-burgers-with-grilling-tips/).

  For the burger patties:
  - 300g of ground beef
  - 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce
  - Salt and pepper for seasoning
  
  For the assembly:
  - 2 stripes of bacon
  - 3 slices of tomatoes
  - 2 slices of red onion
  - 5-6 slices of cucumber
  - 1 tablespoon of honey mustard
  - 2 iceberg lettuce leaves
  - 2 slices of American cheese
  - 1 avocado or go crazy with some harder guacamole
  - Brioche buns  

directions: |
  Mix in the beef with Worcestershire sauce well, shape, and season both sides with salt and pepper. Put the bacon onto a cold frying pan and fry it on medium heat to render out the fat. Set the bacon aside and fry the patties for 3 minutes on high-heat. Then flip, put the cheese slice on one of the patties, cover the pan with a lid and fry for another 3 minutes.

  For the assembly, go for this order: honey mustard, lettuce leaves, burger patties with cheese between them, tomato, red onion, cucumber and bacon. Put the mashed avocado (or guac) on the top bun.

I found this burger while browsing through the archives of The Pioneer Woman. Realising I have some leftover guacamole and all the other ingredients in my fridge, I tried it out and loved it so much, itâ€™s now one of my burger staples.
