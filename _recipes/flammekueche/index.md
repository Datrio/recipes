tags: french, german, pizza

ingredients: |
  - One Flammkuchen pie (recipe will come one day, you can also make a very thin pizza pie)
  - 150g of crème fraîche
  - 1 red onion, sliced
  - 75g of bacon, cubed
  - 1 tablespoon of garlic powder
  - Salt and pepper to taste

directions: |
  If you like garlic as much as me, mix it together with crème fraîche. Otherwise you can ignore this step.

  Put the pie on a hot baking sheet, spread the crème fraîche, and top with onion and bacon. Season with pepper and salt. Bake according to instructions for the pie.

Flàmmeküeche, Flammkuchen, tarte flambée, flame cake, or however you want to call it. It’s one of my guilty pleasures, since you can just buy the typical Flammkuchen pie in a shop, throw in the ingredients together, and you have an amazing meal.
