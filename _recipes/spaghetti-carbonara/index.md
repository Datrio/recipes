  Original recipe by [Not Another Cooking Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90LalTBSIhE).

  - 50g of Pecorino Romano
  - 75g of Parmesan
  - Freshly ground black pepper
  - 2 egg yolks
  - 100g of bacon, cubed (but of course Pancetta or Guanciale will be better)
  - Fresh parsley for garnishing
  - Any kind of pasta you want

directions: |
  The show recommends dried pasta for the starchiness and texture, but I actually find a fresh, chewy one even better here.

  Start by rendering the fat from the meat. Put the bacon in a cold pan, and turn on the heat to low/medium. It should start eventually rendering the fat out. After the meat will brown, reserve the fat and let’s start making the sauce.

  In a double boiler, break in the egg yolks, add Pecorino Romano and 50g of Parmesan and some black pepper. Now start constantly whisking, until you’ll get a nice and creamy texture. It took me 10 minutes, it’ll take you longer/shorter depending on the materials you’re using for the double boiler. In the end, you have to be happy with a creamy consistency.

  In the same time boil some salted water for pasta and cook it. Once this is done, you can start the finishing steps: drain the pasta (reserving half a glass of pasta water), and put it together with the egg mixture. Add the bacon fat and mix that all together. I was mixing this in the pasta pot, off the heat, the heat from the pot was making sure everything will keep slowly cooking. Continue mixing the pasta, eggs, water and fat, until you get a nice, creamy combination.

  Plate the pasta, garnish with parsley, freshly ground pepper, and rest of the Parmesan.

I fell in love with the recipes from Stephen Cusato from Not Another Cooking Show, so when I noticed he was making all the classic Romanian pastas, I decided to try them one by one, starting with the good, old, carbonara.
