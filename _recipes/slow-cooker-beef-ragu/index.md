  Original recipe by [Pinch of Yum](https://pinchofyum.com/slow-cooker-beef-ragu-with-pappardelle).

  - 400g of flank steak, cut into big cubes
  - 4 garlic cloves
  - 1 carrot, chopped
  - 1 onion, chopped
  - 2 bay leaves
  - 2 sprigs of fresh thyme
  - 250ml of beef stock
  - 1 can of crushed tomatoes
  - Olive oil
  - Grated parmesan, a spoon of ricotta and parsley for topping

directions: |
  Heat up the olive oil and brown the meat pieces on each side and garlic cloves. Fry the carrot and onion a bit as well. Transfer all the ingredients from the recipe to a slow cooker and incorporate together. Cook on low for 8 hours. Remove the herbs, shred the beef and garlic with two forks.

  Now having a good consistency is very important. The sauce cannot be very runny, so if it still looks more like a soup, leave it to cook on low for 1-2 more hours, or for 30-60 minutes on high, without the lid on (and don’t go crazy with the smells in the kitchen).

  Cook the pasta or make your own, and put it into the sauce (or the other way around). Mix all together, put on the plate, top with grated parmesan, chopped parsley and a spoon of ricotta.

Slow cookers are amazing - they give you enough unsupervised time to infuse the meat, or anything else, with all the flavours, and give you the chance to prepare food for dinner while you’re at work. I tried this recipe multiple times and it’s still my go-to recipe for anyone who loves pasta.
