ingredients: |
  Original recipe by [Chef John](https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2015/03/scotch-eggs-this-is-easter-egg-you-want.html).

  - 2 Italian sausages (salsiccia with fennel)
  - 2 soft boiled eggs (cooked 6 minutes on low heat)
  - A pinch of nutmeg, cayenne pepper
  - 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard
  - Flour, beaten egg and panko breadcrumbs for breading
  - 500ml of vegetable oil for deep frying

directions: |
  Prepare your breading station. Cut open the sausages and mix the meat with the spices and mustard. Take half of the meat mixture, spread in the palm of your hand, and put the egg inside. Very softly spread the meat around the egg, until it’ll cover it whole. Bread both eggs. If you want to, you can put them to the fridge for a day or two, or to the freezer for longer.

  When you want to fry them, put them into hot oil (170°C) for 5 minutes. If they came from the fridge, add a minute more. If they were in the freezer, 2 minutes more.

  For the sauce at the bottom, I’ve combined some aïoli and honey mustard and sprinkled a bit of paprika powder on top.

While making [Shepherd's Pie](/recipes/shepherds-pie/), I decided to go full UK-ish and make Scotch Eggs as well. Took me A LOT of tries to both make the right set of ingredients for the meat mixture, and don’t break the eggs while wrapping them soft boiled.
