title: Ragù Bolognese
date: 2020-04-17
tags: meat, italian, pasta

ingredients: |
  - 1 carrot, diced
  - 1 small onion, diced
  - 1 celery stick, diced
  - 2 garlic cloves, diced or minced
  - 400g minced beef
  - 1 cup of tomatoes
  - 1 cup of beef stock
  - 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning
  - 2 bay leaves
  - 100ml of red wine
  - Olive oil

directions: |
  Fry the vegetables in olive oil on low-medium heat for around 10 minutes, stirring every few minutes. They should be soft by that time - then add the meat, break it up with a wooden spoon and brown it well. Add the garlic for a minute, mix well, and deglaze the pan by red wine. When the wine will reduce, add the tomatoes, Italian seasoning and the bay leaves. Lower the heat and for the next hour you will be mixing the sauce every 10-15 minutes, while adding a bit of the beef stock if it reduces too much. After that cover with a lid and let it reduce for another hour, still mixing every 15 minutes.

  While I think that there are sauces where dried pasta is best (like any of the traditional Roman pastas), ragù bolognese is perfect with soft, homemade pasta. After the sauce will be done, you can add the pasta to it, mix well, and remove the pasta using a spaghetti spoon, along with the sauce. Put a bit of the sauce on top, cover with as much Parmesan as you want, garnish with some fresh basil and fresh cherry tomatoes (or broil them for a minute to get these amazing caramelised cherry tomatoes).

Maybe people won’t agree with me, but I treat Bolognese as one of these sauces which are hard to mess up. You overcook the veggies? Still good. Fry the meat too much? Good. Choose the wrong tomatoes? Works out. You’ll always end up with an amazing, hearty sauce - perfect to coat freshly made pasta.
