  Original recipe by [The Pioneer Woman](https://thepioneerwoman.com/food-and-friends/5-epic-burgers-with-grilling-tips/).

  For the onions:
  - 2 onions
  - Olive oil
  - 2 tablespoons of brown sugar
  - 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar
  - Pinch of salt

  For the burger patty:
  - 150g-200g of ground beef
  - 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce
  - Salt and pepper for seasoning

  For the assembly:
  - 2 stripes of bacon
  - 3 slices of goat cheese
  - Brioche bun

directions: |
  Slowly cook the onions in olive oil, should take at least 30 minutes. When they are brown, add the sugar, vinegar and mix in all together. Give them 5 minutes more and season with salt. In the meantime put the bacon slices on cold pan and put on medium-high heat. Flip to fry both sides and take off, trying to keep as most fast as possible on the pan.

  For the patty, mix in the beef with Worcestershire sauce well, shape, and season both sides with salt and pepper. Fry one side for 3 minutes on high-heat on the bacon fat, then flip, put on the goat cheese slices and cover the pan with a lid for another 3 minutes, so the cheese will melt better.

Shots of burgers from the top look boring, but this wasn’t boring at all. A great combination of goat cheese, caramelised onions and bacon. The meat was seasoned with salt, pepper and a generous amount of Worcestershire sauce. The burger was fried in the fat which rendered from the bacon and it was divine.
