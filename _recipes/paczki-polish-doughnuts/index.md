  Original recipe by [Kwestia Smaku](https://www.kwestiasmaku.com/przepis/mini-paczusie-lekkie-i-puszyste).

  - 250g of flour
  - 17.5g of fresh yeast
  - 25g of sugar
  - 125ml of warm milk (50° Celsius, 120°F)
  - 50g of soft butter
  - 3 egg yolks
  - 10g of honey
  - Pinch of salt
  - Vegetable oil for frying
  - Powdered sugar

directions: |
  Mix the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt and crumbled yeast) with the wet ones (milk, egg yolks and honey) for a few minutes by hand or in a stand mixer. When it’ll be a cohesive ball, add the soft butter and mix for 10 minutes more. Once everything will get together, put it into an oiled bowl and cover with a towel for one hour.

  Punch it down and put it on a lightly floured surface. Roll it out into a long roll and divide the dough into 15-25g pieces, depends on your preference in size (remember, they’ll be around twice as big when done. I recommend to use a kitchen scale for the first one, and then eyeball the rest). Put them all on some baking paper and leave for 30 minutes, so they’ll grow slightly larger.

  Put a lot of oil into the pot (depends on the pot size, but remember the dough balls should be completely covered by oil) and get it to 170° Celsius (340°F). Make sure you won’t get the temperature way higher - that can burn the dough. Put in as many dough balls as you can, but remember not to overcrowd the pot. Let them fry on each side for 2 minutes, until golden brown. Remove them and put them on a paper towel to drain. After a minute or two out of the pan, while still hot, cover them with powdered sugar.

I’m not a huge fan of sweets (unless it’s making them for someone else), but that’s also why I love those mini Polish doughnuts. They’re quick to make, and even if you mess up, they still end up amazingly good!
