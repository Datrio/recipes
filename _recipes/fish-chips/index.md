  Original recipe by [Marcella Hazan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heston_Blumenthal), presented by [Not Another Cooking Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NL1vB10wM4).

  For the fish:
  - 250g of Cod fillets or another white fish  
  - 100g of flour (+ a bit for dipping the fish before breading)  
  - 100g of rice flour  
  - 150ml of vodka  
  - 150ml of Pilsner  
  - 1 teaspoon of baking powder  
  - 1 teaspoon of honey

  For the tartar sauce:
  - 100ml of mayonnaise
  - Half of small onion, minced
  - 1 tablespoon of capers, minced
  - 3 cornichons, minced
  - 1 tablespoon of chives, minced
  - 1 tablespoon of mustard
  - Zest and juice of quarter of a large lemon
  - Splash of neutral vinegar
  - Salt and pepper to taste
  
  For the chips:
  - 2 large potatoes cut in slices
  
  Other:
  - 1l of vegetable oil for frying
  - Lemon wedge

directions: |
  Cut the fish into smaller pieces (depends how you prefer, I cut mine into five pieces), season with salt and put into the fridge for one hour.

  Meanwhile prepare the tartar sauce, by mincing the onion, capers, cornichons and chives into very fine cubes and mixing with everything else. Put into the fridge until ready.

  Last preparation step, peel the potatoes and cut into slices, however big you want.

  Prepare your breading station, mix in the bowl both flours, baking powder, honey and vodka. Leave the beer for later, you can add it right before breading. Put the vegetable oil into a pot and bring up to 220°C (sorry, don’t know how to measure it without a thermometer - but it should take ~10 minutes on a medium-high heat). Prepare also something to put the fish on after frying - a cooling rack, a plate lined with paper towels, etc.

  When the fish will be ready, put the beer into the batter. Cover the fish with flour and pat it down, then dip it into the batter. Put it into the hot oil (remember to put down the fish away from you, not to splash the oil) and cook for 5-10 minutes, until golden brown. While it’s drying, put in the chips into oil and sprinkle the rest of the chives.

I love fish & chips, but I’m not a huge fun of deep frying. It’s not healthy, it can be a bit dangerous, it’s completely not worth the hassle.

But who cares, we’re making fish and chips tonight!
