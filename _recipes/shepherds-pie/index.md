  Original recipe by [Chef John](https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2012/03/st-patricks-day-special-irish-shepherds.html).

  For the meat mixture:
  - 400g of minced meat (lamb or beef)
  - 1 diced onion
  - 1 diced carrot
  - 100g of frozen peas
  - 30g of flour
  - 1 teaspoon of paprika
  - Pinch of cinnamon 
  - One teaspoon of rosemary, minced
  - 1 clove of garlic, minced
  - 1 teaspoon of ketchup
  - 1 bottle of Irish beer
  - Salt and pepper to taste

  For the potatoes:
  - 3 big potatoes
  - 1 tablespoon of butter
  - 1 tablespoon of cream cheese
  - 50g of cheddar
  - 1 egg yolk
  - 20ml of milk
  - Salt and pepper to taste

directions: |
  For the meat mixture, brown the onion on medium heat and add meat to brown as well. After all will brown, add the flour to coat the meat for 30 seconds. Add all the seasonings: paprika, cinnamon, rosemary, minced garlic, salt and pepper and ketchup. Mix well to coat the meat/onion mixture. Add the beer to deglaze the pan along with the carrot. After 10 minutes of cooking, turn off the heat, add the peas, mix well and spread the mixture at a bottom of a casserole.

  You can do it at the same time, but I like to wait a few hours (maybe even a full day) for the meat mixture to cool down, until you add the potatoes.

  For the potatoes, cook them like you would normally for mashed potatoes, but before mashing them up, put in the cheeses, the egg/milk mixture, butter and seasonings. Then mash it all like there’s no tomorrow.

  Spread the mashed potatoes gently on top of the meat mixture. Put the casserole to the oven for 180 degrees for 25 minutes. For the last 5 minutes you can raise the temperature slightly to brown the top up.

One of my closest friends was always telling me how amazing Shepherd’s Pie is, but I didn’t know just how until I tried it. It’s a creamy meat mixture topped with mashed potatoes - I mean, not only it sounds wonderful, it even reminds me of the food back in Poland due to the combination!
