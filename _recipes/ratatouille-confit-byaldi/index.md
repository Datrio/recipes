ingredients: |
  For the sauce:
  - 1 red bell pepper, 1 green bell pepper, 1 yellow bell pepper
  - 1 white onion, diced
  - 2 cloves of garlic, smashed
  - 100ml of red wine
  - 400g of canned tomatoes
  - 2 sprigs of thyme, without the stem
  - 2 sprigs or rosemary, without the stem
  - 3 sprigs of parsley
  - Olive oil
  - Salt and pepper to taste

  For the shingled vegetables:
  - 1 green zucchini, 1 yellow zucchini, 1 Japanese eggplant
  - 5 Roma tomatoes, skins removed
  - Salt, pepper, olive oil, a bit of rosemary to taste

directions: |
  First prepare the sauce. Cut the bell peppers in half, deseed them, and put them on a high gas burner or under the oven broiler until their skins will turn completely black. Put them into foil for 5 minutes to let the steam help in removing the skins, after which you can just remove the skin from the peppers by hand.

  Meantime, in the pan put in the olive oil and the diced onion, and after it’ll start becoming translucent, add in the wine to deglaze the pan. Add in smashed garlic and herbs.

  In the blender put in the onions mixture, peppers, canned tomatoes, a bit of olive oil, salt and pepper, and mix until smooth. Put the sauce into the casserole dish, reserving a bit of the sauce for decoration.

  Remove the skins from the Roma tomatoes by putting them into boiling water for 30 seconds and then giving them an ice bath. Slice them along with the other vegetables for shingling into thin, uniform pieces (1cm should be good). Put the vegetables, one by one (Remy’s preferred order is green, yellow, purple, red), until you run out of vegetables or casserole. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and chopped rosemary and put a bit of olive oil on top. Cover with parchment paper and put into the oven for 1.5 hours on a low temperature (110°C), after which you can remove the paper and let it to cook for 20 minutes more.

  Get a ring mold and put in the vegetables into it vertically. On top put one small layer horizontally, remove the mold. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.

Confit Byaldi, better known by everyone as Ratatouille, thanks to Remy and Thomas Keller. It takes a lot of time to cut all the vegetables properly, but once you put it into the oven, it’s a very hands-off dish. Perfect as a starting point for any meal!
