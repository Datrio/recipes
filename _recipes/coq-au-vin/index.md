  Original recipe by [Adam Ragusea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lloo1Ksr3ms).

  - Two chicken drumsticks
  - 200g of chicken breasts
  - 150g of fatty bacon, cut into thick stripes
  - 30g of dried mushrooms
  - 15ml of tomato paste
  - 250ml of red wine
  - 500ml of chicken stock
  - 1 tablespoon of Herbes de Provence
  - 300g of pearl onions
  - Salt and pepper to taste

directions: |
  Put the bacon on the cold pan, turn the heat on to low/medium and let the fat render unto the pan. Fry the bacon in it for 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, coat the chicken (drumsticks and breasts) in flour. Afterwards put the chicken into the pan and continue frying on medium heat. Fry everything until slightly brown, and add the tomato paste, also frying it for 30 seconds.

  By now your pan should be slightly brown, so add the red wine to deglaze the pan. With a wooden spatula remove all the sticky brown bits. Pour in the chicken stock to cover the drumsticks, throw in the dried mushrooms, Herbes de Provence, salt and pepper. Mix all together and leave uncovered for 30 minutes. Check how it looks then, taste for extra seasoning, and add the pearl onions. Cook for 30 minutes more, until the sauce will have a good consistency (remember it will still thicken a bit after finishing cooking).

  Serve with mashed potatoes or egg noodles. Top up with some fresh parsley.

I really wanted to try making some stew, and after some research, decided that the typical French coq au vin would be a good choice - but since I don’t like anything typical, I tried Adam Ragusea’s easy-version of it. It was quick and turned out amazing, though I’m not sure how it relates to the classic - but I can still recommend it!
